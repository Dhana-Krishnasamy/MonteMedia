# Monte Media Library

I have copied this source file from http://www.randelshofer.ch/monte/files/MonteMedia-0.7.7src-cc.zip and
 have added pom.xml file so I can generate maven artifact to use in my other projects.
 
I have done no changes to any of the other files. All the credit goes go the author of the library (werner.randelshofer@bluewin.ch).
